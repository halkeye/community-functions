= evergreen-upload


This webhook-based Azure Function is responsible for taking a built
`ingest.json` from
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen[jenkins-infra/evergreen] and
uploading it to the Evergreen backend service layer, effectively kicking off
the upgrade process for evergreen-clients.

== Tainting Update Levels

Tainting of Update Levels can only be done by a single commit which modifies
`servics/essentials.yaml` in the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen[jenkins-infra/evergreen]
repository.

The commit message should include a line with the format of:

[source]
----
Backing out new changes

Taint: <full-commit-sha1>

This turned out to be a very bad idea, and I apologize for the mess I have
caused. I will try not to do it again... :smiling_imp:
